# Score-Prediction
This is my first machine learning project. This project was a submission to the competition "Cricket and Coding" organized by IITM. 
In this competition, we had to predict the runs scored by the batting team after each innings. 
I used linear regression model algorithm to predict the score. 
My overall rank in this compition is 103.
